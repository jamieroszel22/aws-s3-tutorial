        <h2>Create a static website with Amazon S3</h2>
        <p>
          In this tutorial, we will build and host a static webpage on Amazon
          S3.
        </p>

      <section class="content">
        <h3>What is Amazon S3 and How Do Static Sites Work?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)</strong> is a cloud-based
          object storage service from Amazon Web Services (AWS). It's designed
          to store and retrieve virtually unlimited amounts of data from
          anywhere on the web. Think of it as a super-powered online hard drive
          for your files.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Static websites</strong> are built entirely with HTML, CSS,
          and maybe some client-side JavaScript. They don't rely on a server to
          generate content on the fly, making them simple, fast, and often more
          affordable to host.
        </p>

        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Sign up for AWS Free Tier:</strong> Go to the AWS free tier
            page and sign up for an account.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Create an S3 Bucket:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Open the AWS S3 console and create a new bucket. Give it a
                unique name.
              </li>
              <li>Enable static website hosting in the bucket properties.</li>
              <li>Set the index document to "index.html".</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Create a Bucket Policy:</strong> Create a bucket policy that
            allows public access to the contents of the bucket.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Upload Files:</strong> Upload your HTML files (including
            this index.html file) and any other assets (images, videos, etc.) to
            the S3 bucket.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Your Website:</strong> Access your website using the
            endpoint provided by Amazon S3. It will look something like:
            http://your-bucket-name.s3-website.your-region.amazonaws.com
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Additional Notes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You can use any text editor to create your HTML files.</li>
          <li>
            You can upload images, videos, and other assets to your S3 bucket.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can add client-side scripts to your website to make it more
            interactive.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you are done with your website, you can delete the S3 bucket to
            remove it from the internet.
          </li>
        </ul>
